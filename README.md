# BIV
Binary Image Viewer (BIV for short) is a small portable program that allows the user to view a binary image .txt file in a graphical interface.

To use BIV you just need to extract the files included in the latest release into a folder and put the .txt file you want to view in that same folder, then execute the program and type the name of the file and initial scale of the image.

BIV also allows the user to view the changes in the binary image in real time as long as the size of the binary image remains the same.

# Example

A .txt file including the following binary image:

```
000000000000
000000000000
000000000000
000000000000
000010010000
000000000000
000100001000
000011110000
000000000000
000000000000
000000000000
000000000000
```

Would look like this in the program:

**Disclaimer:** BIV is far from perfect, it was hastily created to aid me with a school project since it was extremely annoying to work with just a .txt file full of 0s and 1s, but even so, expect it to work *most* of the time.
